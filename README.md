# Installation

Copy the `Hungarian_Win.keylayout` file into `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` and you can then
select the new layout from System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > Edit.
(The add button is located in the bottom left corner.)

## Removing the previous official layout

You may have noticed that you cannot remove the official layout you had before once you
add the custom layout. You can fix this by following
[this guide on StackExchange](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/60521).

# Layout

This layout puts the most important characters back to
where they are usually on a PC keyboard (for ex.: Windows, Linux; Probably every
single OS got it right, except Mac OSX for some reason).

- 0 is now right left to 1 (rather than í, which moved to Alt+J)
- On international QUERTY layouts you can type í with the key located between
  the left shift and the Z. You can also use that key along with the Z key
  combined with Alt to type the "<" and ">" symbols like on hungarian keyboards.
- Alt is now the primary way to enter symbols eg:
  - Alt-Q is now \ Alt-V is @ and so on.
  - Alt-F and Alt-G are [ and ] respectively.

In general, everything should be where it belongs on a PC keyboard.
